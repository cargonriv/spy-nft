# Data-Life-NFTs

## Description

SpyNFT is an application that will simplify the Web3 community with informative finances. This implementation stems from the trivial lack of trust the Web3 community must build on. Partnering with reliable and track-record-proven entities will provide a sound development of this tool and its features.
SpyNFT works as a tool that interfaces the lookup of Ethereum-compatible addresses and subsequently computing relevant transaction statistics of ERC721s and the native currency (ETH) in the searched address. The app's workflow follows: hCaptcha pass implemented with HUMAN protocol, Connect Wallet function pass implmented with NeftifySDK, and later input any ethereum-compatible address to search that Externally Owned Account (EOA) or that NFT Collection's wallet.

## Requirements

npm (v8.11.0) <br>
nvm (v0.39.1) <br>
hardhat (v2.9.9) <br>
next.js (v12.2.4) <br>
node.js (v16.16.0) <br>
GitKraken (v8.1.1) <br>
http-server (v14.0.0) <br>
eth-utils (v1.10.0) <br>
web3 (v5.30.0) <br>

## Roadmap

The tool essentially integrates any information to particular token holders about the different details from the unique data of those collections that have partnered with the tool and its associates. As of today, the GitHub repo supports the program's initial security layer implemented with the off-chain Proof of Humanity system and the permission given from the NeftifySDK by connecting any ethereum-compatible address. Future plans include integrating the features requested mostly by the voices of the partnered collections and collectors of those collections' communities. Moreover, the implementation of the tokenized gate feature will also be voiced by distinct NFT projects that are understood as timeless acquisitions and/or stewarding innovation to the community. There is also the possibility of including statistics of relevant ERC20s and their transaction's features.
